 * Images the Docker-backed tests start, one constant per image so a tag lives in one place.
 * {@code .github/ci/prefetch-images.sh} reads the values from this file, the way it reads the
 * sidecar pins from {@code application.yml}, so the prefetch cannot drift from the tests.
 * <p>
 * Every image that Docker Hub also carries is named the Docker Hub way. ECR Public meters
 * anonymous pulls by runner IP and by bytes, and GitHub-hosted runners share those IPs, so a job
 * can arrive with the quota already spent or spend it itself: on CI the mirror at
 * {@code public.ecr.aws/docker/library} failed on the first pull of a job, and the Firelens
 * router failed right after the same job had pulled two Lambda runtimes from ECR Public, both
 * with {@code toomanyrequests: Data limit exceeded}. GitHub-hosted runners pull Docker Hub
 * without a limit. The Lambda runtimes stay on ECR Public: their Docker Hub copies lag by more
 * than a year and some tags are missing there.
